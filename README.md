# Python Debugging with ipdb

A Python project for interactive debugging using the ipdb debugger.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use the ipdb debugger to perform interactive debugging of Python code within a Python REPL or script. ipdb provides enhanced flexibility for debugging compared to the standard Python shell.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-debugging-with-ipdb.git
   cd python-debugging-with-ipdb
Install ipdb if it's not already installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install ipdb
Usage
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd python-debugging-with-ipdb
Run the Python REPL:

bash
Copy code
python
Import the debugging script:

python
Copy code
import script_with_ipdb
Run the script:

python
Copy code
script_with_ipdb
The script will pause at the ipdb.set_trace() line, allowing you to use ipdb commands to inspect variables and step through the code.

# Features
Demonstrates how to set up and use the ipdb debugger for interactive Python debugging.
Provides a sample script (script_with_ipdb.py) that contains breakpoints for debugging.
Allows you to explore the flexibility and power of ipdb for interactive debugging.
